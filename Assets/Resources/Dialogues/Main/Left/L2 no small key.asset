  - <Text>k__BackingField: The stone surface of this part of the caves is covered
      in grey moss. There is a weird, gripping smell, something growing more and
      more in presence as I venture into the room. It's... Kind of sweet? Like a
      cup of fruits fresh cut up.

  - <Text>k__BackingField: 'At the other side of the room, a stone pedestal blocks
      my way. Alien inscriptions cross the grey marble. The symbols seem to twist
      and dance before my eyes, before forming actual words, worming their way into
      my mind:'

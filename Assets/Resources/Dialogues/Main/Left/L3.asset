  - <Text>k__BackingField: The words fade away as soon as I finally make sense of
      them in my head.

  - <Text>k__BackingField: Behind the pedestal lies what looks like a giant flower,
      made of flesh and pulsating veins, razor-sharp fangs adorning the edges of
      its 'petals'. The scent of its musk grows stronger and stronger as I approach
      it. Like in a trance, it takes me more and more effort to measure my steps.
    TextAlignment: 257
  - <Text>k__BackingField: I touch one of its 'petals'. It is really soft, like I'm
      touching a velvet dress. At its center, its pistil-tentacle shivers at my contact.
      The whole... Thing... Tenses up, seemingly waiting its lunch to jump in.
    TextAlignment: 257
  - <Text>k__BackingField: Am I imagining it? Is it the musk that makes my head hazy?
      I really want to jump in, like a devouring compulsion. This thing is probably
      going to kill me...

  - <Text>k__BackingField: Any rational being would have done anything else. But
      the musk was so overpowering. I feel hot all over the place, pitching a tent
      in my pents, my erection so strong it starts to hurt. I <i>need</i> relief,
      in whatever way I could have.

  - <Text>k__BackingField: My last piece of cloth didn't even touch the ground that

      part of my body as a strange liquid starts filling the creature's body. Simply
      touching it turned the sensation up to eleven.

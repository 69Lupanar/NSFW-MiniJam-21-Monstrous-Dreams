  - <Text>k__BackingField: There was a loud 'pop', and her porcelain-like face split
      in half vertically, revealing pink tendrils linking both jawbones to the head.
      The inside of her head was covered in pink flesh, strong muscles, and countless
      flesh wriggling out freely in the open now that their protection was taken
      off.

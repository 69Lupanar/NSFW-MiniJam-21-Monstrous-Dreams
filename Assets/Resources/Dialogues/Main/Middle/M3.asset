  - <Text>k__BackingField: At the center of the bridge, a stone pedestal blocks my
      way. Perched on top of it is a statue of a strange quadrupedal animal with
      a somewhat human face. The latter is devoid of any feature, save the pitch-black
      obsidian eyes glowing with an eerie white, reflecting what little light from
      the torches maanges to reach them.

  - <Text>k__BackingField: The creature was completely naked, its modesty only barely
      saved by the thick fur on its limbs. Its belly was completely exposed though,
      as well as the small pair of nippleless tits hidden behind its front legs.

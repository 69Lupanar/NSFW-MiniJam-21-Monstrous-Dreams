  - <Text>k__BackingField: I only now notice a chain collar attached to the guardian's
      neck. A golden key is interlocked to it.
    TextAlignment: 257
  - <Text>k__BackingField: As I reach up to detach it from its owner, I hear a low
      rumbing sound coming from the statue's throat, before it lurches to life!
    TextAlignment: 257
  - <Text>k__BackingField: I only have the time to back away one or two steps as
      the creature leaps in front of me, slowly pacing in a straight line in front
      of the pedestal. It hisses at me, a sound closer to a growl than anything,
      considering it doesn't even have a mouth.
    TextAlignment: 257
  - <Text>k__BackingField: I have to find a way past this guardian if I want to continue.

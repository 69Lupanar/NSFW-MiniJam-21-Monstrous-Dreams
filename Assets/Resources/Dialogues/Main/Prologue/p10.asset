  - <Text>k__BackingField: Feels a bit much for such a small statue. Usually I would
      have asked for five less. But mowing the little thing in between my fingers,
      I didn't feel like bartering anymore. Just going home taking this with me and
      calling it a day.

  - <Text>k__BackingField: The money quickly changes hands, then I go on my merry
      way. I grab a snack, watch some kinds fighting with water guns, but the ennui
      quickly rears its head again.

  - <Text>k__BackingField: I turn tails and quickly head back home. During all this
      time, the statuette still radiates a faint heat in my pocket, so tenuous that
      I might just be imagining it.

  - <Text>k__BackingField: It's probably whatever rock this thing is made of. It's
      not uncomfortable or anything. It's... Quite soothing, actually.

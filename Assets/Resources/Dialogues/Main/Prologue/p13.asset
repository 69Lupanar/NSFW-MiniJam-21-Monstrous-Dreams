  - <Text>k__BackingField: I spend a couple hours, just flicking the switch between
      various programs, waiting for the adult channels to go live. If my mom know
      what she paid the electricity for, she's be so done with me.

  - <Text>k__BackingField: The next few minutes were brief, flicking my bean to various
      pin-ups removing their tops, mixed with some quick fantasies of my ex riding
      me on the couch.

      It was an unassuming statuette, smaller than the others. It resembled... I
      don't know. It looked like the kind of stuff you saw in history books about
      old religions and shit like that. Old monsters, pagan deities. This one definitely
      looked like one.

  - <Text>k__BackingField: Cupping it in my hand, I examine it from every angle.
      The little thing seems to be radiating heat in my hand, so imperceptible that
      it might just be my own body heat.

  - <Text>k__BackingField: The level of detail on this statuette is... Weird. The
      minuscule scales on its back can be felt to the touch. Six pairs of legs, mounted
      on a worm-like body, crowned by three pairs of red gems in lieu of eyes. The
      reflection of the street lamps made them glow with an eerie red... Like it
      was watching me.

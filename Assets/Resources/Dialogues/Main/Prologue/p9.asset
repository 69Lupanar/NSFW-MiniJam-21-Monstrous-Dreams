  - <Text>k__BackingField: Kid me would have probably found it gross. But I don't
      know, it looks... Kinda neat? It's maker sure loved working on it, given how
      it made sure you knew it was a female.

  - <Text>k__BackingField: The tits on this thing are massive... If it were human-sized,
      they would be back-crushing. Especially with this statue having three pairs
      of them. The creator even took the time to sculpt a little slit in between
      its rear legs.

  - <Text>k__BackingField: Should I feel repulsed by this? It's not the kind of stuff
      I'd show my collieagues coming over a cup of coffee, but... I don't know. I
      kinda like it.

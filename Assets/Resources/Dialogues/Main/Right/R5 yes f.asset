  - <Text>k__BackingField: I slowly approach the statue of the girl. After all this
      years, the details of her face are still as accurate as if imprinted in my
      memory.
    TextAlignment: 257

      as wearing only a thin veil, her breats and genitals in full display.

      I've always had of her. But damn, she sure got a gift with that body.

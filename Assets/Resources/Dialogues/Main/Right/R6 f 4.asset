  - <Text>k__BackingField: Eventually, I give in to the sensations. I explode inside
      the statue, my slime coating every inch of her insides, her eyes taunting me
      all the way until the end.
    TextAlignment: 257
  - <Text>k__BackingField: Then, as I finally get to pull out, I take a last look
      at her face, and she seems... Empty? The light in her eyes is gone, same thing
      for that otherworldly attractiveness I felt around her.
    TextAlignment: 257
  - <Text>k__BackingField: She looks diminished, so much so that it seems her facial
      features were eroding away by the second. What was left of my ex slowly fades
      away, until the godly statue was nothing left than a vaguely human-shaped cold
      rock.
